# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Models

This repository contains machine learning models developed for diagnosing breast cancer using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. Two models have been implemented: 

1. **Logistic Regression Model (`antosophia_model_v1`):**
   - Achieved an accuracy of 97.14% on the test dataset.
   - Developed using Python and scikit-learn.

2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model (`antosophia_model_v2`):**
   - Achieved an accuracy of 96.43% on the test dataset.
   - Developed using Python and scikit-learn.

Both models are trained and evaluated within Jupyter Notebooks (`antosophia_model_v1.ipynb` and `antosophia_model_v2.ipynb` respectively) included in this repository.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
3. Explore the Jupyter Notebooks to understand the model development process and evaluation metrics.
4. Run the Python scripts to reproduce the models or integrate them into your own projects.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
